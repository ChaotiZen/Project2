# Project 2

## Task 2-1 Use a drop down list
- First I created the countries-db.php file to handle the interaction with the database. It can be found in the model folder.
- Next, I removed the existing HTML for country code and replaced it with the code found in customer_manager/customer_display.php.
I also had to make some changes to the customer_manager/index.php page. All changes are commented and explained.
